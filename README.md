# Airbnb Price Prediction

A machine learning pipeline that predicts daily Airbnb listing prices in Boston using regression techniques and real-world listing data.

## üîç Overview

This project aims to create a predictive model for Airbnb listing prices using publicly available data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). By automating price prediction based on features such as location, amenities, and property characteristics, hosts can optimize pricing strategies and maximize income. This regression model helps uncover what contributes to higher prices, giving actionable insights to Airbnb hosts.

> This project tackles a real-world problem by applying regression models to scraped Airbnb listing data for Boston, with potential for scaling to other cities or larger datasets.
